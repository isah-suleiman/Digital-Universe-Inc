# User Behaviour Analytics: Analyzing Digital Interactions to Optimize User Engagement & Experience at Digital Universe Inc.

Specialization: Customer and Product Analytics

## Business Overview/Problem

Digital Universe Inc. is struggling to understand how users interact with their digital products and services. They need to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement to enhance user engagement and experience. Without this understanding, the company risks losing customers to competitors and missing growth opportunities.

User interactions have become increasingly complex due to the variety of devices, platforms, and user preferences. This complexity presents several challenges:

1. **User Interaction**: Understanding how users interact with the company's products and services is crucial for optimization.
2. **User Diversity**: The user base is diverse, with varying preferences, needs, and behaviors. Catering to this diversity is essential for a seamless user experience.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: The company aims to exceed user expectations continually, requiring a proactive approach to identifying areas for improvement.

### Rationale for the Project

User behavior analytics (UBA) involves gathering insights into the daily network events generated by users. This is essential for understanding user preferences, pain points, and behaviors. It helps Digital Universe Inc. make informed decisions to enhance user engagement and experience. By analyzing user interactions, the company can identify popular features, optimize user flows, and personalize content, leading to increased customer satisfaction and retention.

Understanding user needs and preferences helps in:

1. **Personalization**: UBA allows the company to understand individual user interactions, enabling personalized recommendations, content suggestions, and user experiences.
2. **Segmentation**: UBA helps segment users based on behaviors, demographics, and preferences, enabling targeted marketing, content creation, and feature development.
3. **Improving Content Recommendations**: By analyzing interactions like views, clicks, and purchases, the company can identify popular content and areas needing improvement, enhancing content recommendation algorithms.

### Aim of the Project

The project aims to leverage user behavior analysis to optimize user engagement and experience for Digital Universe Inc. By analyzing digital product interactions, the company seeks to identify areas for improvement, enhance user satisfaction, and ultimately increase customer retention and revenue.

Digital Universe Inc. aims to:

1. Identify which user types have the highest bounce rates.
2. Understand which features and content resonate most with different user segments.
3. Tailor products and services to meet the unique preferences of various user groups.
4. Continuously improve offerings based on real-time user feedback and data-driven insights.

## Data Importation
**Creating a Date Table in Power BI**

1. **Create Date Parameters:**
   - **Start Date:** 
     - Go to **Transform Data** > **Manage Parameters** > **New Parameter**.
     - Name it "startDate", set type to **Date**, and input '2023/09/01'.
   - **End Date:** 
     - Repeat the above steps, name it "endDate", and input '2023/09/30'.

2. **Generate Date Table:**
   - Click **New Source** > **Blank Query** and rename it to "Date Table".
   - In **Advanced Editor**, rename the source to "Duration".
   - Calculate the number of days: 
     ``` 
     = Duration.Days(endDate - startDate) + 1 
     ```
   - List the dates: 
     ``` 
     = List.Dates(startDate, Duration, #duration(1, 0, 0, 0)) 
     ```
   - Convert to table: **Transform Tab** > **To Table** > **OK**.
   - Rename it to "Date Table" and change the type to **Date**.
**Note: The (1,0,0,0) means one day, zero hours, zero minutes and zero seconds**

3. **Add Columns:**
   - Go to **Add Column Tab** > **Date** and add **Year**, **Week of Month**, **Day**, **Name of Day**.
   - Extract first 3 characters of day names: **Transform Tab** > **Extract** > **First Characters** > 3 > **OK**.
   - Add "Day of Week" column.
   - Create a custom column for week names:
     ``` 
     = "WK" & ([Week of Month]) 
     ```
   - This returned an error because 'WK' is a text and [Week of Month] is an integer. So to fix this I have to use the text.from function
   ```
   = "WK" & Text.From([Week of Month])
   ```
   - Click **Close and Apply**.

5. **Sort and Finalize:**
   - In **Table View**, sort **Day Name** by **Day of Week** and **Week Number** by **Week of Month**.
   - Mark as date table: **Table Tools** > **Mark as Date Table** > **Date Column** > **Date Table** > **OK**.


### Creating a Data Model and Performing Data Exploration in Power BI

1. **Create Data Model:**
   - Power BI automatically connects the `user-profile_data 2` table to the `Session_data 2` table via the `UserID` column.
   - Connect the `Date` column in the `Session_data 2` table with the `Date Table`.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - **Total Sessions Calculation:**
     - Click **Enter Data** in the Home tab.
     - Rename the table to `Measures Table`.
     - Create a new measure to calculate total sessions:
       ``` 
       Total Sessions = COUNTROWS('Session_data 2') 
       ```

   - **Active Users in Previous Month:**
     - Create a new measure:
       ``` 
       Active Users = COUNTROWS('user_profile_data 2') 
       ```

   - **Average Session Duration:**
     - Create a new measure:
       ``` 
       Average Session Duration = AVERAGE('Session_data 2'[Duration]) 
       ```

   - **Average User Rating:**
     - Create a new measure:
       ``` 
       Average Rating = AVERAGE('Session_data 2'[Rating]) 
       ```

   - **Bounce Rate Calculation:**
     - Define bounce rate threshold:
       ``` 
       Bounce Defined = 30 
       ```
     - Create a DAX formula for bounce rate:
       ``` 
       Bounce Rate = DIVIDE(
           COUNTROWS(FILTER('Session_data 2', 'Session_data 2'[Duration] < 'Measures Table'[Bounce Defined])),
           COUNTROWS('Session_data 2')
       ) 
       ```

   - **Most Popular Product Type:**
     - Create a measure to find the most popular product:
       ``` 
       Most Popular Product Type = 
       VAR TopProduct = 
           TOPN(
               1,
               ADDCOLUMNS(
                   VALUES('Session_data 2'[Product Type]),
                   "ProductCount", CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Session_data 2'))
               ),
               [ProductCount], DESC
           )
       RETURN 
           MAXX(TopProduct, 'Session_data 2'[Product Type]) 
       ```

   - **Top Acquisition Channel:**
     - Create a measure to find the top acquisition channel:
       ``` 
       Top Acquisition Channel = 
       VAR TopChannel = 
           TOPN(
               1,
               VALUES('Session_data 2'[Channel]),
               COUNTROWS(FILTER('Session_data 2', 'Session_data 2'[Channel] = EARLIER('Session_data 2'[Channel])))
           )
       RETURN MAXX(TopChannel, [Channel]) 
       ```

- **Compare Subscribers and Churn Rate:**
   - **Churned Users Calculation:**
     ``` 
     Churned Users = 
     COUNTROWS(FILTER('user_profile_data 2',
     'user_profile_data 2'[Aug_sub_type] = "Digital Universe+" && 'user_profile_data 2'[Sept_sub_type] = "Free"))
     ```

   - **Percentage Decrease in Churn Rate:**
     ``` 
     Percentage Decrease = DIVIDE([Aug Subscribed Users] - [Sept Subscribed Users], [Aug Subscribed Users])
     ```

- **Add Welcome Text:**
   - Create a measure to display a greeting based on the time of day:
     ``` 
     Welcome Text = 
     VAR hour = HOUR(NOW()) 
     VAR Greeting = SWITCH(TRUE(), 
         hour >= 0 && hour < 5, "Good Morning Team!", 
         hour >= 5 && hour < 12, "Good Morning Team!", 
         hour >= 12 && hour < 18, "Good Afternoon Team!", 
         hour >= 18 && hour < 24, "Good Evening Team!") 
     RETURN Greeting
     ```

- **Design Dashboard:**
   - Use the calculated measures and welcome text to create an engaging and informative dashboard for stakeholders and team members.
